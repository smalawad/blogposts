                <p class="article-body"><strong>I used to be a pack rat.</strong> I had so many things that I thought
                    that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.

                </p>
                <p class="article-body">Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to
                    live in, and I couldn't
                    hold a relationship.</p>

                <h3 class="article-title">How I turned things around</h3>
                <p class="article-body"><strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of
                        everything.</strong> I literally
                    put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and
                    I quit my job.</p>
                <p class="article-body">It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I
                    didn't know what else
                    to do. And it worked.</p>

                <h3 class="article-title">Now I live the simple life </h3>
                <p class="article-body"> Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less
                    stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.
                </p>

                <p class="article-body">With how much it turned my life around, <strong> felt like I had no choice
                        but to start sharing
                        how I did it,</strong> and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which
                    is why I started this site!</p>
